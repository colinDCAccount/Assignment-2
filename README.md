# Assignment-2
This project uses a Raspberry Pi as a server that reads system information using vcgencmd commands and sends it to a client in JSON format.   The client runs on a PC, connects to the Pi, receives the data, and prints each value on its own line.   Both programs work together to display live Raspberry Pi system stats over the network.
